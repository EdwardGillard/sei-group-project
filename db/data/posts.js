    text: 'I have been meaning to write this post since I announced by pregnancy back in August. A few of you sweethearts have been asking where I have been, how I’ve been feeling and wondering where I’ve been. I am doing really great, and I owe you a major update on my second trimester now that I am almost halfway through my third (eek!). If I am being honest, I have loved slowing down a bit and spending quality time with the people I love most. I have been off my phone for the majority of the Summer and Fall to really enjoy this pregnancy. I took a step back from the blog because something just needed to give. Between work (which I absolutely love), buying our first house, renovating said house, and moving at 31 weeks pregnant, I just found myself not finding the right words or stories to share here. Now, that all of the madness is almost behind us (just in time for another big life change to happen), I honestly have so much to tell you! So, minus the lack of a good outfit to share, I want to tell you about all of the pieces I have been wearing the last few months. I almost created a capsule-like wardrobe for myself because I am determined not to buy too many things that I won’t want to wear post-baby.',

    title: 'My quarantine hair routine',
    text: 'SO, my new routine is as follows: Day 1: Shower, let my hair air dry as much as possible, then follow up with the Waterl<ss Heat Protectant Spray and curl with a thin, 1-inch barrel curling iron. I usually use a 1.5-inch barrel but I’ve decided to embrace my natural wave (otherwise I’d have to blowdry or flat iron it before curling it). It gives me volume and looks cute in a messy bun or ponytail for later in the week. The curl also holds really well. Day 2: Apply Waterl<ess No Residue Dry Shampoo to the roots of my hair, fluff it up and flip it over. Then add the Waterl<ss Weightless Smooth Dry Conditioner to the middle and ends of my hair (this product makes your hair soft, glossy and GORGEOUS). I love it. Day 3: I’ll assess the situation on this day. If I work out, I’ll repeat the same process on day 2 but if not, I’ll let it be and let the natural oils do their thing. I find the bangs almost always need a little bit of dry shampoo but that’s about it. Day 4: Repeat the process of Day 2. Make sure you brush through your hair after applying the product to get it to cover all the hair. Day 5: Assess the situation! Lately, I’ve been making it to day 5 and not hating my hair – which has never happened before! I’ll either shower this day or the next day and start the process all over.',

    text: 'It’s been a while since I’ve shared my Amazon finds with you, so I decided to publish this now before our move gets underway today & things get a little too hectic (can’t believe that we’re leaving New York tomorrow!).  You can see my last post with more of my favorites here.  These are a mix of fashion, home & beauty that I’ve either ordered & am still waiting on or that I’m already using & loving.  Check out the collage below & then read on for all the details + my personal reviews.',

    text: 'I couldn’t be happier for them so I most definitely had to share some of my favorite styles from their recent Modcloth Collaboration. A few things I wanted to mention; everything runs pretty true to size for me (feel free to email or dm me if you have sizing questions). The fit, feel of the fabric and quality are 100 percent worth the price – you will have these unique pieces for years to come.',

    text: 'I love to travel, but that doesn’t take away my love to just simply stay home. I love running after goals, but that doesn’t speed-bump my need to take time to stop and rest. I’m darling to posting on social media, but that can’t influence me into not living my life in the now. I love owning a business, but that can’t take away from prioritizing my family and relationship with the Lord. I may sometimes fear what others think, but that shouldn’t withhold me from fearing God first. I understand my need to feel loved by others but that doesn’t quench my thirst to spend time alone with Jesus. I love writing about buying new clothes, but that will never ever fulfill the void of writing about what doesn’t cost a thing and never sells out: Jesus. Let’s not get caught up in the secular cycle of what the world wants versus what God wants for us. You will never influence the world by being just…like…it. Which one of the above do you relate to most?',
